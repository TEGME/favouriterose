          Mankind has been troubled with many devastating predicaments— such as
          climate change and poverty and hunger and the violation of human
          rights, just to name a few! It is now up to us who are living in
          prosperity to find the solutions to bring usefulness to those people
          in need. Hopefully, with help from God, “The Colour of Your Favourite
          Rose” has now become one outcome of this important endeavour.

                sincerity are so encouraging. They are not blustery, but are
                inspiring in their simplicity and quiet earnestness. Our
                situation, and the planet’s, are dire, and needs hope and faith

                descriptions, but we must search for such words because these
                can move mountains. Mountains need moving. That Mizan is making
                this effort, I hope will lead us to follow his inspiration."

          About The Author
        </h2>
        <div class="author-bio single-col-max mx-auto">
          <p>
            Mohammed Mizan, with his talent for writing and his dedication is
            helping to solve our global financial crisis. He innovated and
            unveiled his “Creative Balance for Development theory” in 1992.
            Since then, he has travelled to some countries to see and experience
            people’s lives and their socio-economic systems which illuminate
            their lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            With these goals in mind, in 2013 he launched his first book of
            poems, Oshojjo. In the same year he also released his first music
            album, Kal Ghum Vangata. In 2015, he released his second music
            album, Blessing. The Voices 2018, 2019, and 2020 contain six of his
            poems.
          </p>
          <p>
            Presently, he continues to spread his message through poetry, short
            stories, and songs mostly through the tegme literary show. Now his
            deepest intention remains to help to stop climate change by bringing
            financial freedom to everyone.
          </p>
          <p>
            He currently lives in Toronto with his wife and three daughters.
